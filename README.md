# Evescore

This application aspires to be the PvE equivalent to PvP kill-boards

## Components

```
gem 'clockwork'     # to run the background jobs like getting data, images
gem 'nokogiri'      # to parse XML
gem "mongoid"       # as the ORM, because getting to know MongoDB better was my secondary goal 
```

## Getting Started

After checking out the source and seeding the Database with info on Rats, Charges and Badges you should be ready to go

## TODO

* add the possibility to choose a character from a key with perms for more than one character
* bring back ranking display in character profile
* think of more achieviement/badge names
* add a separate Rat-O-Pedia section
