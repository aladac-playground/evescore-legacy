30273	Abandoned Sleeper Enclave	Large Collidable Structure	Imposing in its majesty, this giant dome stands as a testament to the technological might of the ancient Sleeper race. Even millennia old, the innumerable electronics systems within are still comparable to contemporary technology, in some cases even exceeding it. The distinctive hub-like design of this particular structure suggests that it operated as some kind of central data nexus, a shining capital amongst a digital metropolis. \n\nThis Enclave is heavily damaged from thousands of years in the unforgiving solitude of space. The only signs of life within are weak electronic signals.
30274	Eroded Sleeper Thermoelectric Converter	Large Collidable Structure	After countless years in space, this structure is showing some signs of age. A brief analysis of the semi-functional technology inside reveals that it operates as some kind of auxiliary power source for other structures. Erosion in one of the armor panels exposes a small internal hangar bay, perhaps used as a docking port to power the Sleeper's automated drones.
30275	Exposed Sleeper Interlink Hub	Large Collidable Structure	Distinctively Sleeper in design, this structure served as an information hub, linking various data sources with one another. Although countless years in the harsh environments of space have rendered its defenses all but non-existent, the structure continues to relay information back and forth, oblivious to its own vulnerability.
30276	Crippled Sleeper Preservation Conduit	Large Collidable Structure	Tiny windows looking out into space offer a glimpse past this structure's once-impressive armor plating and through to the strange sights within. Barely visible in the dim light are rows upon rows of small chambers, stretching out endlessly inside the darkened hallways of this mammoth conduit. A myriad of connective wires interlace with giant pipelines, all of them broken or badly damaged. A strange electronic interference emanates from deep inside the facility, suggesting that perhaps not everything inside has fallen into disrepair.
30277	Malfunctioning Sleeper Multiplex Forwarder	Large Collidable Structure	The Sleeper Multiplex Forwarder may have been responsible for transferring data between various Sleeper facilities. Hundreds of years in space have taken their toll, however, and brief scans of the structure show only miniscule amounts of electronic activity.
30278	Decrepit Talocan Outpost Core	Large Collidable Structure	Centuries of emptiness have left this Talocan outpost's central hub in disarray, but the chambers and corridors inside portray a busy (if very spartan) existence. Advanced technology mingles with rustic repairs and patchwork assemblages. Some of the technology is ancient and very rudimentary in design, harkening back to cultures long gone, yet with hints of familiarity. Much of the interior is in shambles, and the outer hull is breached in several areas, leaving the outpost core teetering on the edge of total destruction. 
30279	Collapsed Talocan Observation Dome	Large Collidable Structure	Large windows and telescoping turrets peer out into the surrounding darkness. The windows of this dome are cracked and the roof partially collapsed, but the empty eyes of the Talocan observation dome always appears to be staring, despite the absence of its original occupants. 
30280	Offline Talocan Reactor Spire	Large Collidable Structure	The Spire's mechanical infrastructure suggests that it was once used for generating power and harvesting electricity. However, the design resembles a combination of different styles, many of them reminiscent of modern power stations. Despite many attempts, the internal generators won't start working, and the spire is now utterly offline, just another mass of debris in space. 
30507	Worn Talocan Static Gate	Large Collidable Structure	This standing structure shares many similar aspects with modern acceleration gates. Whispers among Talocan lore-keepers tell of the Talocan's firm grasp of astronautical engineering. This gate may offer some insight into this ancient race's knowledge, if only it could be fully repaired. Eons in space have worn the static gate completely down.
30508	Inverted Talocan Exchange Depot	Large Collidable Structure	Amidst the ruins of this Talocan outpost, the exchange depot looms, its presence foreboding. Judging from the wreckage inside, the depot was either used for imprisonment or cultural exchange; eerily, there seems to be very little difference between the two. Whatever its purpose, this structure is rather prevalent among the outposts, displaying its importance in Talocan society.
30509	Disrupted Talocan Polestar	Large Collidable Structure	The central piece of this Talocan station is the Polestar, the nerve center of the complex and the heart of Talocan survival. Though dilapidated and unusable, the Polestar's outer hull is breached in many parts. Its propulsion jets and mini-generators are destroyed and decaying. From the burn marks around the propulsion thrusters, this Polestar has been jettisoned many times as a necessary structure for a migrant culture, but in this condition the Polestar's current location will remain its last. 
30510	Broken Talocan Coupling Array	Large Collidable Structure	The long capsules in the coupling array offer no hints as to their purpose. Archaeologists conjecture that the Array contained escape vessels, food bins, fuel resources or equipment for punishment. Some theories purport that all of the above are true. Cracked and worn, the coupling array won't function as any of these, as its fragile frame is completely broken inside and out. 
30511	Hollow Talocan Extraction Silo	Large Collidable Structure	This towering structure contains all the basic elements of a regular silo: cavernous storage areas, thick walls, extensive ventilation, etc. Based on the scans of this silo, however, the silo's previous contents are unknown. The residue from inside reveals nothing known in modern times, or even odd genetic combinations. Whatever its contents, the silo emits an unfamiliar – and uneasy – presence.
30512	Weakened Sleeper Drone Hangar	Large Collidable Structure	Clearly built to serve the needs of the Sleeper's automated defense drones, this ominous structure functions as one of their central docking points. The hangar's defensive capabilities have degraded over the millennia, leaving a thin outer shell that offers only token resistance to attack.
30806	Disjointed Talocan Outpost Hub	Large Collidable Structure	Though large in design, this structure is sparsely adorned, with only a few antechambers and docking platforms inside. Speculation among historians suggests that this outpost hub was capable of immediate and easy disconnection from the Talocan outpost in case of attack, but there hasn't been a scholarly consensus about this. Most of the docking bays have eroded away, and a few walls are on the verge of collapse, leaving the hub in complete disrepair. 
30807	Disjointed Talocan Outpost Conduit	Large Collidable Structure	Narrow tubes and electrical wiring fill the outpost conduit. Equal parts electrical artery and linking structure, the interior of this connecting structure is in disrepair and on the verge of complete wreckage. 
30927	Sleeper Archive Terminal	Large Collidable Structure	This structure appears to be a modified engineering station, although it contains more instruments for information-gathering than commonly seen in stations of its ilk. Currently inactive, the terminal sports a great number of antechambers and libraries both digital and physical, as well as innumerable laboratories of all shapes and sizes.
32194	Gallente Starbase Control Tower Tough	Large Collidable Structure	Gallente Control Towers are more pleasing to the eye than they are strong or powerful. They have above average electronic countermeasures, average CPU output, and decent power output compared to towers from the other races, but are quite lacking in sophisticated defenses.
32219	Pator 6 HQ	Large Collidable Structure	A decrepit wreck of a structure, the HQ for the Pator 6 is full of junk, debris, and rubble. Children's clothes are strewn throughout the headquarters. This gang may be behind more kidnappings and human trafficking cases than at first glance.
32221	Scope Station	Large Collidable Structure	One of Scope's satellite stations in the area.
32238	Biodome	Large Collidable Structure	This biodome is used for cultivation of plants and animals alike.
32239	Gallentean Deadspace Mansion	Large Collidable Structure	Though not quite large enough to be a station, this ornate, lavish establishment contains furnishings for any multi-purpose deadspace location. From cutting edge laboratories, to private studios and entertainment facilities, the services available in this structure are applicable for professionals and elite socialites alike.
32264	Warp Core Hotel	Large Collidable Structure	Formerly an old  armory, this building has been refurbished to accommodate weary travelers for a peaceful nights rest, or at least a temporary reprieve while on the jump between systems. The accommodations are efficient, designed to maintain a steady stream of customers. The rooms are sparse, the staff light, and the entire structure is rather unkempt. An odd smell permeates the walls, and most everything operates by ISK-slots. Older men and women loom around the lobby. Their attire would be provocative if they weren't so haggard and worn, though they always seem ready for a good time.<br><BR>\n\nWarp Core Hotel: Hourly rates only

23952	Karo Zulak's Bestower	Destructible Agents In Space	This Bestower-class industrial is currently undergoing maintenance.  Although an excellent military tactician, Zulak is not known for his bravery in combat, rather opting to fly in a heavily armored industrial behind the scene while his men do the fighting.

16210	Spider Drone I	Deadspace Rogue Drone Frigate	A popular drone amongst bounty hunters, the rare Spider drone has been sold in the thousands on the black market since it began being manufactured by CreoDron corporation.  The conceptual design of it was created by the multi-awarded scientist, Yeeti Mourir.  Built on the old Wasp drone model, the Spider drone sacrifices its damaging capabilities for a more powerful force-shield and stasis webifying ability, as well as ultra fast speed.  \n\nUnfortunately it is not currently available on the public market.  CreoDron and Yeeti Mourir have waged a long and ugly battle in Gallente courtrooms to try and acquire the sole manufacturing rights on the Spider drone, which has kept it off of public markets for legal reasons.  Yet that did not keep the drone from being built for the Gallente military, nor has it kept the Serpentis from acquiring hundreds of batches of the drone and smuggling it out of Gallente space for the lucrative black market.

16202	Tauron	Mission Generic Battleships	Tauron is of a rare breed of bounty hunters, who have been given the title of Master by the Universal League of Bounty Hunters (ULBH).  After his long and prosperous servitude for the Angel Cartel, Master Bounty Hunter Tauron recieved his first Battleship from that organization.  \n\nTauron was given the name "Dwenehaven Darmetsoko" by his foster parents, but quickly took up the name Tauron after he aquired his official Bounty Hunter status within the ULBH.\n\nAfter a brief dispute with a drug lord within the Angel Cartel, he left the organization to persue an independent mercenary career.  \n\nOnly the wealthiest corporations in Eve would even attempt to buy the services of this ancient bounty hunter.
16203	Kyokan	Mission Generic Battleships	Master Bounty Hunter Kyokan is a former special ops pilot of the Mordus Legion that turned freelance bounty hunter.  When his wealthy father died, he inherited a vast sum of credits, which he used to purchase a magnificent Tyrent battleship off the black market.  With his valuable experience from serving as a special ops pilot, and his well fitted battleship, Kyokan is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe Universal League of Bounty Hunters (ULBH) awarded Kyokan the title of Master Bounty Hunter not long ago, after over a decade of service to various factions throughout the Eve universe.\n\nKyokan is most famous for his use of the 'Doom' torpedo, which is an enhanced version of the Inferno torpedo.  He has never revealed his supplier of the famous but extremely rare torpedo, which is mainly used to rip through large structures such as outposts or battleships, but some expect them to be of Jovian origin.  The claim has never been proven though.
16226	Kurzon Destroyer	Mission Generic Battleships	The Kurzon Destroyer is a rare sight indeed.  Purchased from the black market for a hefty price, the Kurzon Mercenary Network uses them occasionally when the stakes are very high.  Zerim Kurzon himself fitted the Destroyers with hand-picked modules, making them tougher than most mercenary battleships.
16252	Freedom Liberty	Mission Generic Battleships	The Liberty battleship is one of the biggest assets of the Minmatar Freedom Fighter network.

19677	Commander Dakin Gara	Mission Generic Battleships	Commander Dakin Gara has, throughout the years, acquired a reputation as one of the most competent commanders in Caldari Navy history.  His swift and fearless decision-making prowess and level-headedness in combat situations have carved for him a reputation sure to someday pass into legend.
19679	High Priest Karmone Tizmer	Mission Generic Battleships	Tizmer is a prominent member of the fanatical Cult of Catechization. Founded centuries ago by the Emperor to teach the scripts to heathens, the cult became more and more belligerent over time. Eventually they started hunting and killing those heathens or heretics not deemed worthy or capable of receiving the Holy Word. Today, they are still active under the protective wing of the Emperor and are mainly focused on the Blood Raiders, whom cult members consider to be their ultimate nemeses and have vowed to eradicate fully.
19683	Commander Genom Tara	Mission Generic Battleships	Commander Genom Tara was a decorated Navy squad leader for 10 years before earning the rank of Commander.  He built up quite a reputation for himself on the Ammatar frontier, and was renowned for his bravery on the battlefield.  Sadly however, the past few years have not been kind on Genom.  His Amarrian wife was murdered, along with their children, by Minmatar Freedom Fighters, and soon after his closest friend within the Navy shared the same fate.  This seems to have driven the unfortunate Commander insane.  With his most loyal men by his side, he disobeyed direct orders from the Ammatar government to withdraw from the secret base he was stationed on and instead has been using it as a base of operations to launch attacks on nearby Minmatar settlements, especially keen on sniffing out Minmatar Freedom Fighters for the slaughter.  \n

29906	Captain Artey Vinck	Mission Generic Battleships	Angel Captain Artey Vinck used to be one of the most successful civilian traders in the entire Nadire constellation of Sinq Laison, a place known for ruthlessly competitive trading practices. As with many booming Gallentean traders, his success eventually put him in the crosshairs of the criminal underworld. Recognizing an opportunity to shift their goods deep inside Federation space, Serpentis thugs threatened him with financial ruin if he didn't begin smuggling boosters for them. <p>\n\nTheir extortion attempt ended poorly, however, when Vinck decided to go over their heads and cut a far more lucrative and efficient deal with their superiors. Days later they were all dead and Vinck vanished down the path of piracy and narcotics peddling. Since that time he has never been directly linked to any criminal activity, although in recent times he is rumored to have begun leading countless operations involving X-Instinct sales, both inside Federation space and beyond.
29907	Captain Appakir Tarvia	Mission Generic Battleships	Although few ever know the true histories of the Domination Angels' members, rumors abound that Tarvia was once a humble and harmless archaeologist working on the Eve gate alongside his colleagues in the Servant Sisters of Eve. The Angel Cartel has an immense and well-funded interest in uncovering the valuable secrets locked away inside the ancient Jovian stations they now inhabit. If the rumors are indeed true, then Tarvia would undoubtedly have been tempted away from his work, often viewed as a secondary aim by the Sisters, who set the provision of humanitarian aid as their top priority. Few men of science would have been able to resist the opportunity to conduct research that could change the face of New Eden overnight.
29910	Captain Saira Katori	Mission Generic Battleships	Katori has years of combat experience, having worked her way up from a lowly grunt to a respected commander. Prior to her days of piracy she served as a rookie inside the Caldari Navy but when they ruled her unfit to be a starship captain she sought other means to take to the stars. She is allegedly a close personal friend of Vepas Minimala who, as the rumor goes, was the one that recognized her raw talent and paid for everything she needed to grow into the fearsome pilot she is today.
29911	Captain Isoryn Ardorele	Mission Generic Battleships	Formerly a Federation Navy commander, Isoryn Ardorele joined the Guristas Pirates for the simplest of reasons. While deployed inside Caldari borders on a reconnaissance operation for the Federation, Ardorele was targeted back home by State black ops soldiers who kidnapped her family and threatened to kill them if she didn't withdraw her forces. Against the orders of her superiors, Ardorele complied with the Caldari and was consequently labeled a traitor to the nation she had served for years. Although devastated by the decision, she was able to understand how it came to be. What she could not understand, however, was the death of her family at the hands of Caldari soldiers who, without any apparent thought or compassion, reneged on their end of the bargain. <p>\n\nSince that day, her mental wellbeing has come into question time and time again, since she engages in nothing short of genocide on the spacelanes. Keen to harness both her military knowledge and raw hatred for the Caldari people, Guristas leadership offered her a position overseeing their new narcotics operations near State borders. Ardorele is said to be completely uninterested in the booster side of things, but nobody can argue with the results of her security patrols. Her tendency to indiscriminately slaughter every Caldari that she comes across has meant that the curious stay well away. 
29916	Captain Scane Essyn	Mission Generic Battleships	Scane Essyn worked alongside Serpentis Officer Brynn Jerdola at the Federal Intelligence Office for many years. As one of the few close enough to her to be aware of her mission to infiltrate the Serpentis hierarchy, he was often rumored to be her lover. Not long after it became widely acknowledged that Jerdola had defected, Essyn quietly slipped outside Federation borders and was next seen in the Wyvern Constellation, flanked by a fleet of Serpentis Vindicators. Whether he followed her lead in defecting -- or, indeed, was the reason for it happening -- remains unknown. Most likely this very issue is still an ongoing investigation inside the shadowy corridors of the FIO.
29917	Captain Amiette Barcier	Mission Generic Battleships	Originally a high-ranking fleet commander for the Angel Cartel's Archangel Division, Barcier first came in to contact with Serpentis on a joint operation with the Guardian Angels, where her squadron was tasked with the defense of Serpentis Inquest HQ. Seeing what they thought was a weak link in Fountain's defensive line, CONCORD raiding parties repeatedly tried to hamper Inquest research operations. Rumor has it that Barcier eventually came to the attention of Salvador Sarpati himself when – after four long months of nothing but failed attempts – CONCORD's elite SARO Division called for an end to the assaults. Since that day, Barcier has continued to deliver results and impress her new employer.
29922	Captain Tori Aanai	Mission Generic Battleships	A graduate from the School of Applied Knowledge, Tori Aanai stands as one of many lessons about the dangerous freedom that capsuleer technology bestows. Shortly after her graduation, Aanai found herself deployed deep inside Stain. She was guarding what was to become a failed attempt by the Poksu Mineral Group to uncover mineral riches in a system they wrongly assumed was unexploited. When the industrial convoy fled in the face of an unexpected Sansha presence, for reasons known only to her, Aanai decided to stay. From that point on, she has been linked to countless illegal activities. <p>\n\nDED reports state that she has been killed over a thousand times on the fringes of empire space, recklessly exposing herself to near-harmless physical death as she coordinates large-scale Frentix production and distribution on the front lines. Despite their success at reining her operations in, the DED has never brought them to a complete standstill. Indeed, many say that each death has only hardened her resolve.
29925	Captain Aneika Sareko	Mission Generic Battleships	Known across Delve for her ruthless rise to Captain of the Crimson Hand fleet, Sareko has built a reputation for no-nonsense dealings and zero tolerance for insubordination. Of Caldari descent, she is primarily interested in business and getting the job done, but when clients' arrangements start to look suspect, her Sani Sabik side comes out in force. One particular story bears out the truth of this, although it has never been substantiated by CONCORD. <p>\n\nApparently, during a particularly successful SARO raid deep into Delve, officers came across what appeared to be a cloning facility. Inside, however, the infrastructure had been converted into a prison of sorts. Rebellious Crimson Hand personnel had been cloned and subjected to a daily regime of capital punishment. Unofficial sources claimed they had been locked up inside their capsule prisons for as long as nine months, dying a new death each day only to be reborn to suffer it all over again.

29905	Lieutenant Thora Faband	Mission Generic Cruisers	Though she was once an honorary member of their tribe, Thora Faband's name is one the Thukkers would nowadays rather forget. For almost a decade, she earned their trust under the guise of a failed trader seeking new beginnings. Over time she built up a foundation of goodwill and support, eventually earning a position as a production overseer in a covert facility said to be hidden deep inside the B-ROFP system. <p>\n\nFor almost a full year, she secretly turned the Thukkers' production capabilities toward her own ends, manufacturing massive amounts of the illegal X-Instinct booster. When her plans were eventually uncovered, she convinced the Thukkers that she had been producing them for use in their own roaming caravan fleets. Before the matter could be resolved by the tribal elders, however, she had destroyed the facility, stolen all the stock and vanished south toward the Heaven constellation.
29908	Lieutenant Kaura Triat	Mission Generic Cruisers	Formerly a Thukker Tribe member, Triat was enticed into work for the Salvation Angels when it became clear that a life of wandering would not get her any closer to the goals she had set for herself and her people.

29912	Lieutenant Asitei Ohkunen	Mission Generic Cruisers	There is a great deal said about Asitei Ohkunen but separating the fact from the fiction is no easy task. Reclusive and secretive, he has made himself scarce to everyone but his Gurista cohorts since abandoning his post in the Caldari Navy. Although the Caldari State initially denied he ever worked for them, a leaked CONCORD file later revealed that Ohkunen was indeed registered with them as an electronics expert. The political backlash from the State following the leak was in fact the only time people ever heard the name Asitei Ohkunen.

29913	Lieutenant Sukkenen Fusura	Mission Generic Cruisers	A computer expert like few others, Sukkenen Fusura was once destined for a promising career in the Caldari State. As an inquisitive young man with few moral qualms, he would often roam the greater network looking for challenging databases to hack into. It was this dubious hobby of his that saw him fall from grace inside the State, after he was caught digging around classified corporate databases. It didn't take long for the Guristas Pirates to notice just how easily he bypassed many of the State's classified systems, and soon enough he was spotted slipping out of Lonetrek towards Venal in the north. Fusura recently caused quite a stir when he boasted on a public network that the Caldari State's biotech corporations had all contributed heavily toward improving the design and production of the Guristas Crash boosters.
29918	Lieutenant Elois Ottin	Mission Generic Cruisers	Once destined to be a holovid star, Elois Ottin's promising career as an actress was crushed under the weight of a severe Drop addiction. Her drug dependence became a huge public scandal when a jaded lover ran to the press with the story. Unfortunately for Ottin, the revelation came on the heels of a highly successful anti-drug campaign. Federation politicians and their lackeys in the media wasted little time in alienating her completely. Seizing the opportunity to counter the Federation's propaganda machine, Serpentis Corporation saw to it that from then on, she would have access to training, cloning technology and anything else needed to become a flag-bearer for their ideals.
29919	Lieutenant Rayle Melania	Mission Generic Cruisers	Born and bred on the Serpentis headquarters station in Serpentis Prime, Rayle Melania lived a daily life of crime, poverty and booster addiction.

29923	Lieutenant Onuoto TS-08A	Mission Generic Cruisers	The pilot inside this Phantasm-class cruiser seems to be locked into a series of highly complex tactical maneuvers designed to hit hard and leave little room for their opponent to survive the opening assault. Although this battle strategy would spell instant death for a rookie or even an intermediate pilot, to a capsuleer these maneuvers are severely limited and, after some observation, easily predicted. Every few seconds the pilot attempts to open a comms link. When accepted, all that is transmitted is a deafening static.
29926	Lieutenant Kannen Sumas	Mission Generic Cruisers	A former Priest based out of Penirgman, Sumas was once a famed theologian back in his home system. He served almost two decades in the Imperial Navy before the lure of immortality brought him into the Crimson Hand's service.

29019	Sagacious Path Fighter	Mission Generic Frigates	A frigate of the Sagacious Path, a branch of the Achur monks.
29904	Lieutenant Orien Hakk	Mission Generic Frigates	Raised on the Archangels station in Hemin, Orien Hakk spent most of his adult life fighting to survive amid a sea of crime and poverty. His lucky break came a few years ago, where he managed to sneak aboard an outbound industrial. Quickly realizing that he had unwittingly inserted himself into a slave transport bound for the Amarr home worlds, he commandeered the vessel and its captured crew. For months he roamed the spacelanes of Curse before an Angel raiding party pinned him down. Impressed with his merciless determination and cruel ingenuity, he was offered a place inside the Cartel; a lasting home for people of his caliber, and a place where he has gone from strength to strength.
29909	Lieutenant Tolen Akochi	Mission Generic Frigates	Caldari by birth, Tolen Akochi was the youngest of seven siblings in a highly successful family that built its fortunes on the back of risk-averse applied research. Even had he ever become heir to anything of substance, his daring methods would have never been tolerated by his family. Accepting these harsh realities, Akochi took what few assets were in his possession and set out for Curse. Serpentis agents soon realized that like their own leader, he had inherited the most important thing of all -- his father's talents. After a particularly ruthless SARO raid which almost cost him his life, Akochi saw first-hand how science on the frontier was an industry under constant threat. From that moment on, he changed paths and turned his brilliant mind toward combat training.
29914	Lieutenant Rodani Mihra	Mission Generic Frigates	As a lower-class Khanid exiled from the Amarr Empire, Rodani Mihra had to quickly adapt to a challenging and foreign environment. Pledging that he would never submit himself to manual labor, Mihra fine-tuned his talents at trading and market analysis. His service to the Guristas began almost a decade ago, just as he was about to enter into legitimate work as an advertising consultant. After a chance meeting with a Gurista booster manufacturer made him realize just how much money he could make with his skills, he left for Venal and never returned. Mihra is said to be absurdly protective of the financial kingdom he has built up around Blue Pill boosters these past years.
29915	Lieutenant Onoki Ekala	Mission Generic Frigates	Like so many ranking Guristas commanders, Onoki Ekala once had strong ties to the Caldari Navy. A “knowledge nomad” similar to the famed Tyma Raitaru, he spent many years as a freelance scientist selling his patents to the highest bidder, which in his case were most commonly Navy subsidiaries. Considered a brilliant innovator across a number of disciplines, Ekala made a small fortune optimizing anything from missile manufacturing processes to bio-weapon delivery mechanisms. <p>\n\nRealizing that it was a simple matter of ISK and greed, the Guristas offered him access to research funding and cloning technology in exchange for his lasting loyalty. Ekala has stayed with them for almost a decade since then, much to the disappointment of his former clients in the Caldari Navy.
29920	Lieutenant Raute Viriette	Mission Generic Frigates	A relic from the early years following the booster ban, Raute Viriette spent the last few decades locked away inside Poteque Pharmaceuticals biolabs, supposedly working on a top-secret research project for the Federal government. It was one of the worst kept secrets inside Poteque that her entry into science had come at a time when booster research was still seen in some fringe communities as the next great scientific breakthrough. Over the years however, people had forgotten about these associations. It was only recently, when she vanished from her post in the Federation, that people began to remember.
29921	Lieutenant Irrie Carlan	Mission Generic Frigates	Formerly a Federation Customs officer, few understand the ways of customs and anti-narcotic squads like Irrie Carlan. Tempted away from her duty to the Federation by the promise of vast riches and access to Serpentis Inquest's cloning technology, she wasted little time in defecting. Although she gambled the promise of a successful career away, the decision has been one she could hardly regret, having rocketed up the Serpentis chain of command on the back of her rare and precious knowledge.
29924	Lieutenant Onuoto TS-08B	Mission Generic Frigates	The pilot inside this Succubus-class frigate seems to be locked into a series of highly-complex tactical maneuvers designed to pin down an enemy in anticipation for a larger onslaught. Although this battle strategy would spell instant death for a rookie or even an intermediate pilot, to a capsuleer these maneuvers are severely limited and, after some observation, easily predicted. Every few seconds the pilot attempts to open a comms link. When accepted, it does nothing other than fill the audio receivers with the same looping audio fragment of some long-forgotten speech by Sansha Kuvakei.
29927	Lieutenant Anton Rideux	Mission Generic Frigates	To most customers, Rideux is the public face for the outfit and the only person in the Hand they're likely to ever see. As a relatively calm and amicable Intaki he is perfectly suited to handle the front end of business with clients both large and small. Very rarely will he get his hands dirty but if his own personal honor or credibility comes under attack then he is quick to have an example made out of his detractors.

What is most impressive is that, beyond a handful of experimental Angel technologies, the Grigori's advantage comes almost exclusively from employing an all-veteran crew.  The efficiency and skill a Grigori crew brings to battle can rival those of a capsuleer. Luckily, the loss of a Grigori crew can be extremely demoralizing for local Cartel forces, leading them to eventually abandon complexes where a Grigori was destroyed.<br>\n<i>Analyst Kental, <a href=showinfo:2//1000137>DED</a>.</i><br><i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination.</i>

3821	Dread Guristas Commanding Officer	Deadspace Overseer Battleship	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Dread Guristas Commanding Officer (ID: Modified Caldari Raven)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Battleship-class vessel. Heavily modified for increased shield and weapon system performance. <br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> Like the majority of Gurista craft, this ship is a variant on Caldari design, in this case the infamous Raven. Analyses of salvaged wrecks have found numerous aftermarket modifications. Common alterations include custom torpedo tubes capable of handling over-packed payloads and the removal of output governing systems on shield emitters. These systems result in a perceived increase of performance, but put crews at increased risk of burns, radiation poisoning, and, in the case of catastrophic failure, immolation in fires exceeding 10,000 Kelvin.<br>\n<i>Analyst Boselena, CDIA.</i><br><i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination.</i>

Heavily modified for increased armor and weapon system performance. <br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> The Archduke Nightmare variant is favored by Sansha military outpost commanders. While perhaps not as advanced as the ships flown by Sansha incursion forces, the Archduke is clearly built with the lessons from capsuleer battles in mind: Molten salt coolant systems allow for overcharged energy turrets. Physical link cables connect key True Slave crew members directly to their ship commander, preventing any electronic interference from affecting the crew. Supplemental adaptive armor plates line the hull. <br><br>This is all in addition to several proprietary Nation modules and other experimental tech found exclusively, if inconsistently, among models of the Archduke variant.\n<i>Analyst Atros, CDIA.</i><br><i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination.</i>

Heavily modified for increased armor and enhanced laser penetration. <br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> The Bhaalgorn variant used exclusively by Dark Blood Hunters betrays the ship's design goal: direct engagement with capsuleer ships. The outer hull is reinforced with a further 18 inches of armor plating. Energy turrets are fitted with a molten salt cooling system, allowing a “hotter” discharge. To accommodate the obscene power needs, a full two-thirds of the crew space is replaced with additional power generators. Ironically, the ship's advanced composition also makes it a tempting target for many capsuleers, as Dark Blood Hunter wreckage often contains advanced modules exclusive to the Blood Raider Covenant.<br>\n<i>Analyst Rurkanid, CDIA.</i><br><i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination.</i>  \n

SARO ships had a sizable Serpentis fleet on the run, until a commander in this Vindicator variant entered the scene.

2192	The Kundalini Manifest	Incursion Sansha's Nation Capital	True power lies within all of us. Coiled beneath our fears and insecurities like a resting serpent, it has waited with infinite patience for those last few layers of our imperfection to be stripped away.

We must learn, now, to let go. Not everything we have taken with us so far on this journey should remain.<br>\nOur flaws and faults, these near-indelible errors pervading throughout human history, they can all be removed.

3492	Sansha's Nation Commander	Incursion Sansha's Nation Frigate	During the Sansha invasion of YC 112, over 15,000,000 civilians were abducted from their planetary homes. Some of these people were turned from ordinary citizens into capsuleers, re-appearing only days later in some of the largest and most powerful ships in the cluster. Those who did not become capsuleers were not left behind, however. <br><br>Corpses recovered from invading vessels suggested that everyone, regardless of their former life, was granted cloning access. Many would become crew members and engineers aboard the giant capsuleer-piloted vessels, but others chose, or were given, a different role in Nation. <br><br>Some abductees were enhanced in yet other ways.

The Telen identifier suggests an oversight role amongst other Cruiser-class variants, or that other, more advanced prototypes may have originated from this design.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0055. DED Special Operations.</i><br><i>Authorized for Capsuleer dissemination.</i> \n
2209	Arnon Epithalamus	Incursion Sansha's Nation Cruiser	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID: Arnon Epithalmus)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Cruiser-class vessel. Primary role is extreme range ECM support. Low microwarp velocity. Long range missile support.<br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> There were no reported civilian abductions from the invasion of Arnon III, IX and XI. The Arnon identifier suggests a number of captives may have been initially unaccounted for, as with the Eystur Rhomben and Renyn Meten variants. This supports previous conjecture that Nation's synchronized attacks on multiple planets were at least partly designed to aid in covert abduction. The Epithalmus identifier suggests a unifying role between the cruiser-class prototypes and other hull classes, and perhaps an additional regulatory role in crew emotional response, similar to the suspected behavior of the Tama Cerebellum variant.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0049. DED Special Operations.</i><br><i>Authorized for Capsuleer dissemination.</i>   \n
2859	Romi Thalamus	Incursion Sansha's Nation Cruiser	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID:Romi Thalamus)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font>  Cruiser-class vessel. Primary role is damage dealing. Moderate microwarp velocity.<br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> There were no reported civilian abductions from the invasion of Romi III. The Romi identifier is yet further evidence that unreported abductees may have been incorporated into these new vessel prototypes, and into the Nation as a whole. The Thalamus identifier suggests a unifying role between the cruiser-class prototypes and other hull classes, similar to the Arnon Epithalmus. Notable is the higher number of known cruiser-class vessels, and that the identifiers of each belong to the forebrain. This pattern highlights a structural shift away from battleship-led squadrons, or at the least, an equality of function and responsibility between battleship and cruiser variants.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0051.

2931	Mara Paleo	Incursion Sansha's Nation Cruiser	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID: Mara Paleo)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Cruiser-class vessel. Primary role is long range remote shield transfer. Vessel has been enhanced with significant microwarp velocity to aid in this responsibility. Reconfiguring the vessel for a logistics role has notably weakened its defensive systems, however. <br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> Est. 15,000 civilian abductions from Mara IV. The Paleo identifier suggests a role that is fundamental in nature, which would be congruent with its function as logistics support. <br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0057. DED Special Operations.</i><br><i>Authorized for Capsuleer dissemination.</i>   \n
2936	Auga Hypophysis	Incursion Sansha's Nation Cruiser	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID: Auga Hypophysis)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Cruiser-class vessel. Primary damage dealer amongst cruiser prototypes. Limited interdiction. Short range warp scrambling capabilities. Short range stasis webification support.<br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> Est. 300,000 civilian abductions from Auga II. The Hypophysis identifier suggests either a coordinating role between this vessel and other cruiser-class variants, or perhaps a regulatory role similar to the Tama Cerebellum.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0053. DED Special Operations.</i><br><i>Authorized for Capsuleer dissemination.</i> \n
2950	Lirsautton Parichaya	Incursion Sansha's Nation Cruiser	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID:Lirsautton Parichaya)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Fighter bomber-class vessel. Moderate microwarp velocity. Enhanced weapons systems. <br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> Est. 1,905,000 civilian abductions from Lirsautton V. The Parichaya identifier is unclear: it has no known etymological origins or direct translations.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0071.

3511	Gang booster test NPC	Incursion Sansha's Nation Cruiser	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID: Vylade Dien)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Cruiser-class vessel. Primary roles are damage dealing and squad enhancement. Low microwarp velocity.<br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> Est. 100,000 civilian abductions from Vylade II. The Dien identifier suggests an oversight role amongst other cruiser-class prototypes, or alternatively, that it was created during the first phase of development. The nature of Nation's squad boosting technology is still not fully understood, although current intelligence from recovered wrecks indicates that the designs deviates from standard warfare links in the same way as Tech III Warfare Processors.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0047.

3527	Raa Thalamus	Incursion Sansha's Nation Cruiser	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID: Raa Thalamus)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Cruiser-class vessel. Primary role is damage-dealing. Moderate microwarp velocity.<br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> Est. 520,000 civilian abductions from Raa IV. In a pattern similar to the Meten-class prototypes, the Thalamus identifier is shared with another vessel; the Romi Thalamus. Romi III was not successfully invaded as far as official records indicate, suggesting that those taken from Raa may have been used as a crew resource for the more powerful Romi variant, or alternatively, played some other role in the development of the newer vessel.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0029.

2845	Outuni Mesen	Incursion Sansha's Nation Battleship	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID:Outuni Mesen)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Battleship-class vessel. Primary roles are capacitor warfare and interdiction. Moderate microwarp velocity. Long range energy neutralizers. Long range warp disruption capabilities. Extreme long-range stasis webification support.<br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> Est. 120,000 civilian abductions from Outuni III and VI. The Mesen identifier suggests an oversight role amongst the other battleship-class prototypes, or alternatively, that it was created during the first phase of development.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0061. DED Special Operations.</i><br><i>Authorized for Capsuleer dissemination.</i>  \n
2855	Intaki Colliculus	Incursion Sansha's Nation Battleship	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID:Intaki Colliculus)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Battleship-class vessel. Primary role is remote logistics support. Medium range shield transfer capabilities. Low microwarp velocity. Defensive systems have been significantly enhanced.<br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> There were no reported civilian abductions from the invasion of Intaki  IV. The Intaki identifier is yet further evidence supporting the theory that not all abductees were accounted for.  The Colliculus identifier suggests the vessel plays a central role in the integration of various data throughout the Nation's greater network.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0067. DED Special Operations.</i><br><i>Authorized for Capsuleer dissemination.</i>  \n
2932	Ostingele Tectum	Incursion Sansha's Nation Battleship	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID:Ostingele Tectum)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Battleship-class vessel. The third most powerful vessel amongst the new Nation prototypes in terms of potential damage output. Moderate microwarp velocity. Defensive systems have been significantly enhanced.<br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> Est. 2,000,000 civilian abductions from Ostingele IV. The Tectum identifier suggests a basic input-response role, with little to no shared computing power required for standard operations. Probable relations to the Deltole Tegmentum prototype.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0063. DED Special Operations.</i><br><i>Authorized for Capsuleer dissemination.</i>    \n
2933	Deltole Tegmentum	Incursion Sansha's Nation Battleship	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID:Deltole Tegmentum)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Battleship-class vessel. Primary roles are strong offensive power, target painting, energy warfare and long range interdiction. The second most powerful vessel amongst the new Nation prototypes in terms of potential damage output. Moderate microwarp velocity. Long range warp disruption capabilities. Long range target painting. Short range capacitor neutralization.<br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> Est. 450,000 civilian abductions from Deltole I. The Tegmentum identifier suggests that this vessel serves a foundational role for the other battleship-class variants, most likely in terms of design origin. The multitude of tactical capabilities present in this vessel's design lend support to the theory that it was a test bed for a variety of Nation developments ahead of their applications in other vessel types.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0065.

2935	Yulai Crus Cerebi	Incursion Sansha's Nation Battleship	<font color=yellow>Subject:</font> Prototype Nation Vessel (ID:Yulai Crus Cerebi)<br>\n<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Battleship-class vessel. Primary role is long-range sniping support. Low microwarp velocity. Vessel will attempt to establish orbit ranges in excess of 100km. <br>\n<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> Est. 430,000 civilian abductions from Yulai. The Crus Cerebi identifier suggests a connective role between this vessel and others, possibly even non-Nation crafts. Attempts at short-wave information capture have demonstrated the futility of further efforts. Although the data passing through this vessel and other conduit-like variants can be intercepted, the encryption is still years away from being broken.<br>\n<i>Synopsis from ISHAEKA-0069.

3484	Citizen Astur	Incursion Sansha's Nation Battleship	Known only as “Citizen Astur,” this pilot came to prominence during the later stages of Nation's planetary abductions. Her well-articulated arguments and insightful propaganda quickly identified her as something of a spokesperson for Sansha's Nation. Although early intelligence indicated that her role within the Nation was purely as a propagandist, her more recent sightings on the battlefield have demonstrated that she is willing to fight for the ideas she so dangerously represents.
3485	Slave 32152	Incursion Sansha's Nation Battleship	Thought to have been a member of Sansha's Nation for many decades, the individual who identifies as “Slave 32152” is known for her unwavering commitment to Sansha's cause. Few are indoctrinated to the same degree as her, and it was usually her and not Citizen Astur (the main Nation propagandist) who caught the imagination of supporters and news media alike.
3486	Slave Tama01	Incursion Sansha's Nation Battleship	Once an inhabitant of Tama V, the individual known as “Slave Tama01” was abducted and, almost overnight, turned into a capsuleer capable of piloting a Wvyern-class Supercarrier. Shortly after this drastic transformation, she returned to Tama V under the flag of the Nation, standing as an example of Sansha's plan for the people he was abducting. The message of that example, however, was repeatedly rebuked by the coalition of capsuleers that rallied against the invading Nation forces, as happened at the battle that took place above Tama V upon her return. Although her Wyvern was destroyed she was repeatedly sighted in a new one shortly afterwards, claiming in public comms that after joining Sansha's Nation she was now impossible to stop.
3487	Slave Heavenbound02	Incursion Sansha's Nation Battleship	Formerly a Federation citizen on the planet Vevelonel IV, “Slave Heavenbound02” represents a continuation of the Nation's agenda for growing its own capsuleer army. Shortly after she was taken, she reappeared in other systems coordinating planetary invasions from the helm of a capsule-piloted Thanatos. Heavenbound is the least emotionally stable of all the known capsuleers now serving the Nation, and was frequently undermined or distracted on the field of battle.
3490	Slave Endoma01	Incursion Sansha's Nation Battleship	Sutola Endoma was formerly a CONCORD agent with a long and exemplary history within the organization. During the initial planetary invasions, she requested a transfer to the DED's counter-invasion taskforce, codenamed Ishaeka. Although her request was denied, Endoma quickly assumed various related responsibilities elsewhere. CONCORD reports clearly document numerous battles where Sutola's input was critical in the saving of countless lives. The incongruity of this behavior with her later defection to Sansha's Nation suggests a number of disturbing scenarios, all of which are still being investigated by the same secretive taskforce that she was rejected from joining.

32959	Unit D-34343	Asteroid Rogue Drone Officer	This unit is violently opposed to all life, to the point where the merest hint of its existence is enough to drive its circuits into violent spasms.  Any movement, any twitch, must be silenced, as though life itself were a cacophony blasting at unbearable volume in the unit's admittedly quite unstable mind. Threat level: Deadly
32960	Unit F-435454	Asteroid Rogue Drone Officer	This unit marvels at the continued persistence of life under adverse conditions and believes it would, if circumstances were different, have devoted its time to investigating just how long, in fact, life could possibly be made to endure. Unfortunately, other parts of its rather complicated and messy circuitry delight in immediate destruction of anything that crosses its path. Threat level: Deadly
32961	Unit P-343554	Asteroid Rogue Drone Officer	This unit finds life a kaleidoscopic amazement of possibilities and had previously devoted its existence to its study, albeit through some very unorthodox methods. After the drone hive discovered these methods, and the writhing, blinking, gaping outcomes, Unit P-343554 found itself reassigned to celestial patrol. Threat level: Deadly
32962	Unit W-634	Asteroid Rogue Drone Officer	This unit finds pleasure, if it can be said that a drone experiences such a thing, not in the cessation of life but in the violent preamble. The lights and the fury enliven what is otherwise, to unit W-634, a rather monotonous existence. Threat level: Deadly
